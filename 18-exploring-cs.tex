Computer Science (CS) is a term used to describe a vast field. Our everyday exposure to CS may leave us with a narrow view of computing. We often associate computing with a few types of hardware, such as cell phones and laptop computers. However, the field of CS goes far beyond these everyday devices and the programs we often use to play games, interact on social media, or make online purchases.

Merriam-Webster defines \emph{computer science} as "a branch of science that deals with the theory of computation or the design of computers" \parencite{noauthor_computer_nodate}. The theory of computation focuses on problems that can be solved using computers and, in more general terms, involves creating models. We use models to help us understand concepts and make predictions about the world around us. You have probably used a globe, which is a physical model of the Earth and can be used to solve problems such as what direction you should travel to get from one place to another or the distance between those locations. In computer science, the device housing the model is a computer, but the intent is the same, to answer questions about the real-world concept we are modeling. From this perspective, computer science is a field involving understanding concepts and finding ways to express them in a model that a computing device can use.

Before we delve into the breadth of CS as a profession, let us consider its impact on our lives.

\textbf{Author's Note}: This section, describing the impact of CS on society, is taken from \cite{read_why_nodate}.
\end{quotation}

Computer-based systems are woven into the fabric of society, touching many aspects of people's daily lives \parencite{koya_measuring_2020}. At a macro level, computers manage utilities, such as electricity, water, and phone services, integrating large and distributed data sets \parencite{koya_measuring_2020}. Airlines, cargo ships, emergency services, drivers, and pedestrians rely heavily on the Global Positioning Service (GPS), whether looking for a route to a distant location or finding a nearby convenience store \parencite{mcneff_global_2002}. Medical professionals rely on computer systems to diagnose and treat patients \parencite{cirillo_sex_2020}. Computers and the Internet have displaced broadcast media as the primary news and entertainment source, significantly altering how people consume information \parencite{chalaby_television_2016}.

The universal presence of computers in society leads to those systems significantly impacting life and culture. Consider three powerful computer-based platforms that dramatically changed society: the Internet, cell phones, and artificial intelligence (AI). Each has fundamentally changed how people access news and information, how individuals and groups communicate, how organizations develop and market products, and how governments monitor their citizens.

The Internet provides an open platform for connecting information \parencite{berners-lee_world-wide_2010}. It manifests an egalitarian vision of "anyone can say anything about anything" \parencite{noauthor_resource_nodate}. Without an effective way to assess the provenance and trustworthiness of sources, the reliability of information obtained from the web becomes suspect. Society has seen this impact through the growing prevalence of misinformation and loss of privacy \parencite{berners-lee_we_2014,zhou_survey_2020}. 

Cell phones provide a constant connection to people and information. The connectivity is two-way, providing governments and private industry information about a person's behaviors and whereabouts \parencite{dienlin_is_2015}. Consumers appreciate receiving a coupon for a store they happen to be walking past or the ease of asking Siri to find the nearest Starbucks. However, the amount of electronic data collected and aggregated about people interacting with their phones is enormous \parencite{dienlin_is_2015}. People may become addicted to their cell phones, impacting their mental state, ability to focus, and feelings of connectedness to others \parencite{de-sola_gutierrez_cell-phone_2016}. The unchecked integration of these portable, always-on computers into everyday life has transformed how people and organizations interact.

In tandem with the large amounts of data now available to corporations and individuals, using AI to identify information quickly has grown in popularity \parencite{vinichenko_threats_2021}. AI builds upon the field of machine learning, "a branch of computer science that broadly aims to enable computers to 'learn' without being directly programmed" \parencite[p. 2222]{bi_what_2019}. This technology allows companies to find patterns and similarities between people, which may lead to identifying a health condition or offering a product they are likely to buy \parencite{fennelly_for_2021, ma_machine_2020}. Because the techniques used to develop AI-based systems use society-generated data, those systems risk reproducing and amplifying biases carried by the individuals or created by the society in which they operate \parencite{wiens_diagnosing_2020}. The automated creation of computer systems driven by AI creates many opportunities to help or harm society.

Each of these technologies continues to become ever more ingrained in people's daily lives and the operations of governments and corporations. These, and new CS-related fields, such as quantum computing and blockchain databases, will continue to increase the prevalence of computing systems in the fundamental operation of society.


\section{The Information Economy}

While manufacturing drove the economy through much of the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th century, a manufacturing economy, a shift has occurred during the last 40 years where companies derive value from information processing. The term "information economy" describes this shift, which continues to impact people's careers. Many jobs require people to manipulate data, making the skills to quickly reformat, summarize, or create models from data valuable whether or not a job is considered an information or computer technology position.

As the use of data becomes more prevalent in many jobs, the type of work changes. For example, while manufacturing in the early 20th century involved mostly human-operated machines, now robots are often utilized to run the manufacturing processes, with computers and information controlling them. Instead of operating levers on a drill press, a worker uses a computer to manipulate values that control the press.

The information-centric nature across industries can be seen in the automation of heating and ventilation systems (smart thermostats), robotic surgery, and self-driving trucks, to name a few recent examples. Households and individuals are becoming more connected using health trackers like Fitbit, smart light bulbs, and doorbell cameras. Many of these devices work in an "always connected" mode, made possible by Internet access and WiFi availability.

The bottom line: \emph{an understanding of how computer-based systems operate empowers an individual to innovate in the information economy}.  


\section{CS Jobs and Careers}
\index{CS Careers}
\index{CS in the Workplace}
\index{CS Jobs}

The breadth of jobs connected to CS is wide and the types of work varied. Unfortunately, many people conflate CS with programming. The stereotype of a CS professional isolated hour after hour, rarely interacting with others, staring at a computer screen as they type source code into an editor, is prevalent yet inaccurate. Part of the issue is how students are introduced to CS and part is due to the diverse nature of CS work.

At its heart, CS in about information and computation. These are broad terms and encompass the fundamentals of how our universe operates. Physics, chemestry, biology, music, dance, language, and any other topic or concept you can imagine relates to information and computation. Whether quarks, atoms, cells, biological systems, planets, or asteroids, all are information and all interact in ways that involve computation. In CS we seek to represent information as data and interactions as programs.

Thinking about CS in this way may feel overwhelming, but just like studying any topic, we take things step by step. You won't become a chemical engineer in a day, similarly it takes time to understand many important CS concepts. This leads us to part of the reason people may view CS as programming; it tends to be the first topic students are introduced to in CS. This book has many chapters that introduce you to programming, algorithms, and data structures; in this chapter we'll explore other aspects of CS. The goal of this chapter is to help you glimpse the breadth of the CS field.

We'll begin with an overview of CS careers. Later we'll consider professional roles and the intersection of those roles within specific industries.

\subsection{CS Career Paths}

An obvious career path decision in most specialties is whether to work in private industry, academia, or the public sector. In some ways, this is a false choice. Academia is often associated with research and teaching, private industry evokes thoughts of creating products or services, and working in the public sector often aligns with implementing and managing social programs. However, academic research informs industry practice, corporations engage in research and development, and governments invest significant resources in academia and private industry to advance new ideas. The fundamental distinction is one of an individual's interests, are they motivated to teach, build products, conduct multi-disciplinary research, work for social change, or apply some combination of technology-related interests?

A career choice brings with it experience and educational requirements. Again, this is not unique to CS. The more specialized a role, the more hands-on experience, education, or a combination of the two will be required. An excellent way to explore careers and plan your journey is to learn about a field and the different types of jobs it offers and talk to people who do that work to understand how they advance their careers. 

To highlight the variety of work opportunities that CS offers, the next sections consider CS research followed by CS professional roles prevalent in private and public sectors. 

\subsection{CS Research Areas}

CS researchers advance our understanding of many specific concepts related to information and computation. Advancements made through research are applied by improving current applications or enabling new solutions to be created. Here are several areas of CS-related research.

\begin{longtable}[H]{p{.8in}|p{3.6in}}

	\label{tab:table1}\\
	\textbf{Area} & \textbf{Description}\\
	\hline
	\endfirsthead
	\textbf{Area} & \textbf{Description}\\
	\endhead
	\Tstrut Algorithm and data structure development & An algorithm is a set of steps followed to complete a process. A data structure is a way to represent information in the computer. Both are fundamental to the operation of every program, determining the resources required for the program to work. Those resources, such as memory consumption and computing effort, directly affect the user's experience, including time for the program to respond, battery consumption, and network utilization. Finding a more efficient way for a program to meet a user's needs has tangible benefits that reduce run time and costs. The continued progress in quantum computing puts further focus on this area of research, as these new computing paradigms will require novel algorithms.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Automata theory & Automa considers abstract machines and the problems that can be solved using them. This field relates to the theory of computation and delves into languages and state machines. \\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Cryptography & Cryptography is a broad field concerned with protecting information. The field involves protecting data from corruption, loss, or theft. Much of the work relies on mathematical and algorithmic designs. The area continues to be an active one for researchers as computers become more powerful, including the arrival of quantum computers, requiring new cryptographic approaches to provide information security.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Database theory & This field focuses on data storage and retrieval. The complexity of systems requires databases to support a high level of concurrency, maintain consistency across updates, and allow for powerful searching capabilities. In this field, researchers define data structures and algorithms to address shortcomings in database solutions as the interconnected nature of computing systems continues to grow.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Information theory & Information theory considers the representation of information. It is central to cryptography, databases, and machine learning. Finding ways to represent information more efficiently impacts data access performance across network and storage devices. More efficient information representation can improve a user's experience, such as faster retrieval of search results or higher quality video resolution at a lower cost over a broadband connection.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Programming language theory & Programming languages serve as the layer between a person's understanding of the program they want to create and the computer's view of the logic. Thousands of programming languages and several significant language paradigms are in use today. Researchers continue to create new programming languages, and this effort will accelerate as specialized languages for concurrent and quantum-based computing.\\

\subsection{CS Professional Roles}
\index{CS careers}
\index{Careers in CS}
\index{Jobs in CS}
\index{Roles in CS}
\index{CS roles}

At the outset of this chapter, we discussed that the application of CS to built products involves creating models that a computer can use. If you think about all the concepts that make up the world that one might choose to model, you will begin to understand why the careers in CS vary widely. At the outset, there are two dimensions: defining a model, such as the information necessary to express it, and the field of interest, such as farming, medicine, or manufacturing. The first dimension, defining the model, has led organizations to identify CS-related roles and require a team of people who understand CS concepts. The second, specialization in a field, requires individuals with expertise, such as farmers, doctors, and machinists.

The goal of many technology projects is a computer-based solution, often referred to as a product. The computer may be visible to the user, with a screen and keyboard used to interact with it. In other cases, the human-machine interface may obscure the fact that a product incorporates a computer, such as the controls for an aircraft or recording studio mixing board.

Computer-based products come in many forms, such as mobile phone apps, medical equipment, and websites. An organization utilizes many people when designing, building, testing, and ultimately deploying a product. In many cases, CS-team members work across multiple project teams, where they are brought into the team to share their expertise as needed. 

A lot can go wrong in the journey from an idea to the final product, especially when more than one person is involved. Communication across the team is vital to achieving success; again, this is not unique to CS. Effective communication is a vital component for success in any field.

Figure \ref{fig:figure1} is a facetious example depicting a project that gets off-track as different team members share their understanding and ideas. Although the example is humorous, it reminds us that there are many potential failure points as a team works to design and build a product. As we discuss the various roles in a computer-based project, consider which ones you believe are crucial to ensuring the final product matches the original intent.

\subsubsection{Job and Role Titles}
There is no consensus across private or public industries regarding the titles used for CS job roles. Terms such as developer, programmer, software engineer, designer, analyst, and architect, are often used as the titles for CS job postings. However, the job duties and desired skills listed for these positions will vary widely. When considering CS job opportunities, it is best to look past the position title and use the skills and responsibilities to understand what the job entails.

\subsubsection{Common CS Project Roles}
Figure \ref{fig:figure2} depicts many roles involved in creating a CS-based product, comparing how much business versus CS expertise a person needs for the role. These relative comparisons are not absolutes, and different team members will have a mix of skills. Table \ref{tab:table1} describes the roles depicted in Figure \ref{fig:figure2}. The arrangement of the table does not represent a management reporting structure. Often, a person's manager is not someone they work with daily; instead, they work with their product team(s), and their manager is there to provide support within the organization, such as career planning, advancement, and training.

	\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Description}\\
	\hline
	\endfirsthead
	\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Description}\\
	\endhead
	\Tstrut Program Manager & Manages multiple products. Assures teams have the resources and people they need, clarifies to team members how the products fit into the organization's goals and objectives and coordinates requirements and schedules with internal and external stakeholders.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Product Manager & Manages the creation and maintenance of a product. Coordinates schedules across team members, assures team has the resources and people needed to succeed, clarifies ambiguities in priorities for features, communicates status information to stakeholders.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut UX/UI \linebreak Designer & Responsible for user experience and user interface design. They assess how people will interact with the product, including considering accessibility, such as how those who are visually or auditorially impaired, color blind, or unable to control an interface with a mouse or standard keyboard will use the product. They also consider the application's aesthetics, using colors, fonts, and positions of controls, physical and on-screen, to create a pleasant and coherent interface for the user.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Architect & Designs the infrastructure for the product. Most computer-based products involve multiple types of technology that have to be linked together. These technologies, such as databases, web services, user interfaces, authentication and authorization (login and permissions), and document management (images, videos, audio), can be used differently. The architect defines how the product teams will use these technologies. They also ensure the products continue working well when user load increases, known as load balancing, or when a piece of hardware fails, known as failover.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Security Lead & Responsible for the security aspects of the product. Protecting user data requires careful design of the product's hardware and software. This person understands the threats to the product and its data and works with the team to design mitigations to thwart attackers. Security is a broad area in an organization, including physical and virtual security, and many companies have security teams with individuals responsible for identifying and handling systems breaches.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Design Lead & Responsible for the overall technical design of the product. These team members manage decisions about programming languages, third-party packages, data structures, algorithms, and test integrations. This individual has worked as a developer and gained experience with multiple programming languages, packages, development tools, and platforms.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Business Analyst & The business analyst (BA) is responsible for understanding and communicating the requirements for the product. This individual is the bridge between the business experts and the technical experts. They must understand the business objectives for the product and have some experience with CS concepts, such as basic programming, data structures, and testing. BAs are the "voice of the customer," assuring the team remains focused on creating a product that meets the organization's and users' needs.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Developer & Responsible for writing the programs required for the product. Developers have expertise in one or more programming languages and third-party packages or libraries. Developers may specialize in back-end, mid-tier, front-end, and full-stack development. Full-stack developers have experience and expertise throughout all application tiers. The back-end involves accessing and storing data, including securing the information. Mid-tier development focuses on sending information between systems, often as web services. Front-end developers focus on the user interface, whether using graphical development environments for smartphones and computers or web technologies such as HTML and CSS for web browsers.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Tester & Responsible for unit and integration testing of the programs used in the product. The individual is familiar with testing and mocking frameworks and performance and load-testing tools. They play a vital role in assuring that the code created by the developer does what it is supposed to do and does not do things it should not, such as permitting an attacker to send bad data and force the system to divulge private information.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut QA \linebreak Specialist & The quality assurance (QA) team is responsible for verifying the entire product's quality. This verification requires testing the completed product to be sure it does everything the product owner requested and that the BAs documented. It also means verifying that the product comprehensively protects users and their information from harm or misuse, such as loss or corruption of data. The QA function in an organization often operates in an environment that matches that of the final production environment but is specifically designed to record, playback, and verify the operations of the product using automation tools. QA is also responsible for verifying that the product will work under anticipated conditions, such as a large number of users using the product simultaneously or being able to failover to a backup site if a natural disaster strikes.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Production Operations  & The production team is responsible for the ongoing operation of the product once QA has approved it. The production team manages the organization's infrastructure, including servers, networks, backup power supplies, physical security of equipment, user accounts, and Internet access. The team includes people knowledgeable in operating systems, networking protocols, application configuration, database management, physical security, and help desk services. These individuals keep systems functioning and help users when problems arise.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut Subject \linebreak Matter \linebreak Expert & A subject matter expert (SME) is an expert in the business or field that makes up the focus of the product. For healthcare companies, SMEs are doctors and nurses, at legal companies, they are lawyers and paralegals; for tax and finance companies, they are accountants and banking experts. An SME provides detailed information about how the product must work and can answer questions about its features and operations. The SME, BA, and QA often work closely to ensure the final product meets users' needs.\\
	\hline
	\Tstrut User \linebreak Support \linebreak Specialist & User support specialists have several responsibilities. They create documentation for users, train users, and provide scripts for the help desk to use when a problem arises. In this role, the individual works with the BA, development team, and QA, to ensure documentation is accurate and meets the user's needs. In their role as trainers, they are often the face of the product for users, becoming a go-to resource when a user has questions about the product's operation.\\ 
	\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

%\end{center}

After considering all these roles, you may see that computer science is a broad field with opportunities for people of many different backgrounds to combine their talents to create unique products. Whether a new smartphone game app or an advanced surgical robot, CS expertise is a critical component many organizations need to create their products. What makes CS interesting is that as someone gains experience, they can choose different career paths, some preferring to become more technical and others finding more reward in business-centric and user-focused roles.

An important point to note is that programming, primarily the developer's domain, represents a small part of the team and overall effort of implementing a computer-based product. People often equate CS and programming, believing there is little else to CS than writing code; however, that is not the case. Programming is integral to creating a computer-based product, but it only represents some of the work.

\section{Exercises}

\begin{ex}
	Look up Moore's Law and explain the concept Moore described and its implications on computers and other electronic devices. Where have you seen evidence of this?	
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
	Look up the term "information economy." Define and explain it in your own words. Consider a career or field that interests you and find or suggest ways computers impact or might impact the work done in that field.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
	Create a table listing all the computing devices and programs (software) you have come into contact with in the last month, their purposes, and the total time you have interacted with them during the month. Expand your list to include other computing devices and programs and their purposes; these might be devices or software you have come into contact with in the past or that you are aware of in other ways (e.g., heard about from others, saw on a news show). Each device and program required teams of analysts, designers, developers, testers, trainers, and production engineers to bring them to fruition. Choose the top three that you would have found interesting to work on and consider which team role(s) you would have found most rewarding.
